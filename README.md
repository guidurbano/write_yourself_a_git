# Write yourself a Git

Implementation of the Git from scratch.
To understand the fundamentals of Git, the CLI tool was developed using Python
and basic shell. The idea comes from [Thibault Polge article](https://wyag.thb.lt/#intro).

The entire application is based on a `wyag` command.

## Installation

## How to use it

A very simplified version of Git core commands was implemented.

To create a new Git repository:
``` bash
wyag init [path]
```

# TODO: explain use of poetry and cli
